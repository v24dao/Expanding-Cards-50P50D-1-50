## About the course:

### Why I am completing this course?

- To maintain a high level of familiarity with vanilla HTML & CSS, whilst working on other projects that use Bootstrap and TailwindCSS.
- To learn about new JavaScript concepts and to actively apply the JavScript concepts which I already know.

### My approach to the projects in this course

In regards to the JavaScript portions of these projects, I aim to complete as much as possible without reference to the corresponding videos.

I shall utilise resources such as [google](https://www.google.co.uk), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and my own notes.

Upon completion of each project, I shall compare my solution with Brad's and write about:

- What I have learnt from the project
- Resources which have helped me (if any)
- Any plans for continued development

## About this Project

### What I learned

- Initially, I tried to use the `.querySelector` method to target the panels. However, I was only able to target the first panel.
- I needed to use the `.querySelectorAll` method to create a "NodeList" of the panels
- The next step would be to use the `.forEach` method to target the individual panels.

### Useful resources

- `.querySelectorAll` : [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll)
- `.forEach` : [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp)
